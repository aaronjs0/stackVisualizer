Compile with a C compiler and make an executable.  
Run it like any other C program.  
 
It'll ask you to specify the number of variables you are going to input.  
When you enter your variables, the name must only be one character long.  
Input should look exactly like this:
 
     int a
     char b
     long c
 
Don't end the lines with a semicolon, just press enter and input each 
variable on a new line.  
 
It can accept a char, short, int, long, float, and double.  Making any 
of these unsigned or constant won't change the output. An 'X' represents 
padding, so don't name any variables 'X' because then you won't know where 
the variable really is.  At this point, it can't deal with arrays.
 
I currently have it set to hold 50 stack frames, but if you want more you 
can change STACKSIZE

EXAMPLE OUTPUT:

Number of variables to initialize : 12
int a
char b
short c
int d
float e
double f
float g
char h
char i
char j
short k
char l
